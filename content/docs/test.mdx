## Introduction

Fumadocs can be broken down into two parts: Core and UI.

**Core** handles most of the logic, from search functionality, to MDX plugins.

**Fumadocs UI** is the official user interface for Fumadocs.

### Terminology

For a better understanding of the docs, there are some common terminologies you should know:

**Content Source:** The source of your content. Fumadocs MDX, CMS and Contentlayer are examples of content source.

**Page Tree:** A tree of all the pages, separators and folders. It is essential for navigation elements. See [Page Tree](/docs/headless/page-tree).

**MDX File & Page:** A MDX file could be located in a folder, or available remotely. Instead, MDX Page is only referring to `page.mdx`, which is already a page on its own.

You might need to be familiar with Next.js App Router to continue.

## Automatic Installation

Create a new app with `create-fumadocs-app`, it requires Node.js 18+.

<Tabs groupId='package-manager' persist items={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>

```bash tab="npm"
npx create-fumadocs-app
```

```bash tab="pnpm"
pnpm create fumadocs-app
```

```bash tab="yarn"
yarn create fumadocs-app
```

```bash tab="bun"
bun create fumadocs-app
```

</Tabs>

It will ask you the following questions:

- Which content source to use? (Recommended: Fumadocs MDX)
- Configure Tailwind CSS?
- Install dependencies?

After that, it will initialize a new fumadocs app.
Now you can start hacking!

### Enjoy!

Create your first mdx file in the docs folder.

```mdx title="content/docs/index.mdx"
---
title: Hello World
---

## Yo what's up
```

Run the app in development mode and see http://localhost:3000/docs.

```
